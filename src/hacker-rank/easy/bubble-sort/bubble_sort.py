Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order
        if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {
            swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);
        }
    }
    
}

Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement, where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement, where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you must add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Example
a = [6, 4, 1]

swap    a       
0       [6,4,1]
1       [4,6,1]
2       [4,1,6]
3       [1,4,6]

The steps of the bubble sort are shown above. It took 3 swaps to sort the array. Output is:

Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 6

Nathan's Note: This function has been modified to return a tuple for the purposes of making it easier to test.
