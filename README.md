## BUILT WITH

-   The code challenge solutions use [JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/index.html)
-   The JavaScript tests are written with Facebook's [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for unit testing, while Python uses its built-in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.html#assert-methods). Java and Solidity tests are coming soon.

## GETTING STARTED

1. Fork or clone this repository to your local machine

2. For JavaScript challenges:

    - Open your terminal and install Jest using `yarn global add jest`
    - Navigate to the parent directory and run Jest by entering the command `jest --watch`
    - Select which method of testing in `Jest` you want to use via the command line prompts

3. For Python challenges:

    - Open your terminal and install dependencies via `pipenv install`
    - Start a shell environment by running either `pip shell` (or, if you have it installed, preferably `pipenv shell`)
    - Navigate into any directory and run files using the `python3 <file name here>` command

4. Modify some of the code in a test file to watch the magic happen
