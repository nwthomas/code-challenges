## Built With

- The code challenge solutions use [JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- The JavaScript tests are written with Facebook's [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for unit testing. Java tests are coming soon.

## Getting Started

1. Fork or clone this repository to your local machine

2. Open your terminal and install Jest using `yarn global add jest`

3. Navigate to the parent directory and run Jest by entering the command `jest --watch`

4. Select which method of testing in `Jest` you want to use via the command line prompts

5. Modify some of the code or the test cases to watch the magic happen
